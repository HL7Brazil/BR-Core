### Udpate Argonaut Data Query DSTU2 IG to FHIR Version R4.

Description: The Argonaut experience dictates robust implementation guides that require real implementation and testing.  For this project, the Argonaut Data Query DSTU2 IG will be update to FHIR Version R4 with the goal of having consistency among implementers to meet the [USCDI requirements](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/us-core-data-interoperability-uscdi). Includes adoption and testing of US Core R4 resources; adding Encounters and Clinical Notes and consideration of  adding “write” capability for a subset of the resources.

The Contents of [US Core Implementation Guide CI Build( V3.0.0)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/) have been forked on June 1, 2019 to create the starting point for this implementation guide.

The Contents of [Argo R4 build] have been merged back into this IG on Aug 30th, 2019 to create [US Core Implementation Guide CI Build( V3.0.1)] for STU comment at HL7.
